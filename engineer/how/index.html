<h2 id="how-">How?</h2><p>Anyway, as long as it works and is easy to follow through consistent conventions.</p><p>A StackEngine (this project) consists of a build system of tasks with standard npm packages and common modules.The goal is to have one known build system to tune and a common collection of modules that are known to work together.</p><p>StackMates consist of configuration files to draw the application out standard npm modules and common modules and app specific modules.</p><p>The idea is to free you to create solutions in new imaginative evolving solutions on top of a solid base.</p><p>As an ecosystem the idea is to expand then contract, that is grow the code in the project then slowly contract down to modules that are free to join other systems. As central principle is to mirror how life system operate where nothing is permanent.</p><p>Only rule is clear communication of intent by connecting why with how.</p><h2 id="theory">Theory</h2><p>This project is working to the idea that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk-CF7klLdA">your app no longers exists</a> as presented by Fred George.</p><p>In it’s place is the ability to identify problems see the opportunities and solve them with a culture that is unafraid to break stuff.</p><h2 id="principles-values">Principles / Values</h2><ul><li>Expand then contract, make it work, then make it better</li><li>We are divided by common language, but <strong>the sequence of questions we ask ourselves provide an anchor</strong> is what really helps understand each others ideas.</li><li>Be opinionated enough to provide clear direction but flexible enough to change course without hangups</li><li>Philsophers ask questions, dreamers wonder why, realists ask what, engineers explain how, be all of these.</li><li>Go with the chaos, then find the pattern</li><li>Consistency of style is important,</li><li>Communication is more important than being clever</li><li>Don’t want it, don’t require it.
